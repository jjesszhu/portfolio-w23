### my personal site

hello! welcome to my personal website :sunglasses:

drawing inspiration from Wes Anderson's [THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS](https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/The-Royal-Tenenbaums.jpg), 
I designed and developed this site after picking up some front-end skills at my w2022 co-op. 

the site is bootstrapped with Create React App, hosted on GitHub Pages, and uses basic CSS styling (for now :eyes:).
