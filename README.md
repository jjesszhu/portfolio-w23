### my personal site

Hello! Welcome to my personal website B) 

Drawing inspiration from Wes Anderson's [THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS](https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/The-Royal-Tenenbaums.jpg), 
I designed and developed this site after picking up some front-end skills at my w2022 co-op. 

The site is bootstrapped with Create React App, is hosted on GitHub Pages, and uses basic CSS styling (for now).

### improvements / working on...

Right now, I'm working on adding a feature that scrapes my letterboxd RSS feed (with the help of zactopus's npm library) to show what I've watched recently in a simple film diary.

Another future feature will be to add animations for the cards/text for pizzazz ;)

On the recommendation of a front-end mentor, I also want to migrate the basic CSS I've used and try out styled components in the future!
